      <h2 class="conclusion-title">Conclusion</h2>
      <hr>
      <p class="conclusion-p"> Through research, I have found that many people are not satisfied with the arrangement of their rooms
        when they check into a hotel. For example, the location of the room, the floor plan, and the arrangement of the facilities
        inside can all cause dissatisfaction among customers.
        <br> For this project, I designed a hotel system: filtering out unorganized floors and available rooms based on customer's requests.
        Customers can always check the layout of the room and the view from the window, allowing them to be selective when booking their stay.</p>
      <p class="blue">Challenge in the future</p>
      <p class="conclusion-p2">In the future, I will improve this project by adding a payment interface, a login interface,
        and a service interface. In this project, due to the technical and space constraints, I was not able to show the room
        style in 360 degrees and could only show a two-dimensional pictures (including the interior styling of the room and
        the view outside the window) to customers. In the future, this will be one of the technical goals that I will try to overcome.
